******Image To Latex******

This is the final project code for DS301 fall 2023, by Sydney Cao, Owen Ou and Jacob Xue

Project Goal: build a model that effectively transcribe images that contain mathematical formula into LaTex code. We will experiment with several model implementations and find out the best model for the  task. 

****Model Architecture:****

encoder-decoder framework

Encoder: CNN-based with Positional Encoding

Decoder: RNN-based( Double-layer BiLSTM) + attention 

Training: Cross-entropy loss, MLE

Dataset: IM2LATEX100K 

****Note:****
The experimentations with encoder that we tried but is not applied in the final model (eg: Resnet Encoder) are in the OtherEncoder.py file.
